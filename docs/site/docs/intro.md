# Introduction to MigrationPilot

MigrationPilot is an AI-powered platform for modernizing legacy code. It transforms applications written in COBOL, Fortran, Visual Basic 6, and legacy Java into modern languages like Java, Python, TypeScript, Go, and C#.

## What Makes MigrationPilot Different?

Unlike traditional transpilers that produce unreadable code, or manual rewrites that take years and cost millions, MigrationPilot uses a multi-agent AI architecture to:

- **Understand** your legacy code's business logic and intent
- **Design** a modern architecture that fits your needs
- **Generate** clean, idiomatic code that developers actually want to maintain
- **Validate** that the new code behaves exactly like the old

## The Four AI Agents

MigrationPilot uses four specialized AI agents, each with a specific role:

### 🔍 Archeologist Agent
Analyzes legacy code to extract:
- Business rules and calculations
- Data structures and relationships
- Control flow and dependencies

### 🏗️ Architect Agent
Designs the target architecture:
- Module decomposition
- Service boundaries
- Database schema mapping
- API contracts

### 🔨 Builder Agent
Generates modern code:
- Clean, readable implementations
- Unit and integration tests
- Documentation

### ✅ Validator Agent
Ensures equivalence:
- Generates test cases
- Runs parallel executions
- Reports confidence scores

## Key Features

- **Multi-language support**: COBOL, Fortran, VB6, legacy Java → Java, Python, TypeScript, Go, C#
- **Business rule extraction**: Preserves domain knowledge with high confidence
- **Human-in-the-loop**: SME review and correction of extracted rules
- **Equivalence testing**: Proves the new code does what the old code did
- **Incremental migration**: Supports strangler fig pattern for gradual rollout
